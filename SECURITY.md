## Reporting a Vulnerability

**⚠️ Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

This project runs in production environments, and public disclosure of vulnerabilities before a fix is available could harm our users.

### How to Report

Report security vulnerabilities via one of these private channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred): Use the "Report a vulnerability" button in the Security tab of this repository
2. **Email**: david@frontegg.com (include "enclave-vm" in subject)

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Status updates**: At least every 14 days
- **Resolution target**: Critical issues within 30 days

### Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted in good faith to be authorized. We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:
- Act in good faith
- Avoid privacy violations and data destruction
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond proof-of-concept
- Report findings promptly and privately

### Disclosure Policy

We follow coordinated disclosure. We will publicly acknowledge your contribution (unless you prefer anonymity) after a fix is released.

Key points:

1. Use GitHub Security Advisories - built-in private reporting, no email exposure
2. Clear "do not" statement - explicitly tell people not to use public issues
3. Response timeline commitments - sets expectations
4. Safe harbor - encourages researchers to report without fear of legal action
5. Update the version table - yours shows 5.x but your repo is at 2.x
